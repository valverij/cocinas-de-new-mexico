## Molletes (Anise Seed Rolls)

**Yield:** 3-3 1/2 dozen  
**Temperature:** 375°F  
**Baking Time:** 20-25 minutes  
**Freezes Well**

### Ingredients

1 package active dry yeast  
2 tablespoons sugar  
2 cups warm water (105°-115°F)  
1/2 cup shortening  
1 1/2 cups sugar  
2 eggs  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 teaspoon anise seed  
6-7 cups flour  
Margarine

### Steps

1. Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a large mixing bowl. Set aside.

2. In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream shortening with sugar. Beat in eggs and add salt and anise seed.

3. Add creamed mixture to yeast and thoroughly combine. Gradually add flour to mixture until a moderately firm dough is formed. Knead dough on a lightly floured board until it is smooth and elastic.

4. Place dough in a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise until it is double in size.[^1]

5. Punch dough down, knead, and allow to double in size again.

6. Knead dough and shape into round balls the size of an egg. Place in a well-greased pan, cover, and allow to double in size again.

7. Lightly brush with margarine and bake in a 375°F oven for 20-25 minutes.

**NOTE:** Molletes are usually served with chocolate or coffee in this form.

[^1]: Yeast dough should be allowed to rise in a warm location. It should never be allowed to rise in a heated oven. Dough is double in size when an indentation remains after a finger has been inserted into dough and removed.
