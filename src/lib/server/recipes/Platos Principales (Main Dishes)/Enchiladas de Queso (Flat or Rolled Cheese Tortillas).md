## Enchiladas de Queso (Flat or Rolled Cheese Tortillas)

**Yield:** 4 servings  
**Temperature:** Medium-High, 350°F  
**Heating Time:** Approximately 15 minutes  
**Freezes Well**

### Ingredients

12 corn tortillas[^1]  
Shortening  
4 cups Red or Green Chile Sauce[^1]  
3 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese  
2 onions, chopped  
2 cups coarsely chopped lettuce (optional)

### Steps

1. Heat 1/2 inch of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

2. Quickly dip each tortilla into the shortening to soften. Drain on absorbent towels.

3. Assemble the enchiladas by placing 1/4 cup sauce on each dinner plate, followed by a tortilla (tortilla can be rolled after filling is placed on it), 1/4 cup sauce, 1/4 cup cheese, and onion. Repeat twice. Top with remaining sauce.

4. Place in 350°F oven for 15 minutes, or until the cheese melts. Garnish with lettuce.

**NOTE:** Traditionally, enchiladas are topped with a fried or poached egg before serving.
