## Chalupas (Filled Tortilla Boats)

**Yield:** 12 chalupas  
**Temperature:** Medium-High, 375°F  
**Heating Time:** Approximately 10 minutes

### Ingredients

Shortening  
12 Corn Tortillas[^1]  
Salt  
3 cups Frijoles Refritos[^1]  
2 cups Red or Green Salsa[^1]  
2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese  
1 1/2 cups shredded lettuce  
2 tomatoes, chopped

### Steps

1. Heat 4 inches of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

2. Fry each tortilla in hot shortening, submerging it with a round, wooden roller, ladle, or similar object. (Tortilla will form into a cup shape.) Drain on absorbent towels and sprinkle lightly with salt.

3. Fill chalupa with 1/4 cup of beans, 2 tablespoons of salsa, and 2 tablespoons of cheese.

4. Place chalupas on a baking sheet and heat in a 375°F oven for approximately 10 minutes, or until cheese melts.

5. Garnish chalupas with lettuce, tomato, and guacamole before serving.
