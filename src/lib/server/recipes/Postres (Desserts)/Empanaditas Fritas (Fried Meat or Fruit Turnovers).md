**Yield:** 6-9 dozen[^1]  
**Temperature:** Medium-High  
**Total Frying Time:** 20-30 minutes  
**Freeze well**

### Ingredients

1 teaspoon active dry yeast  
1 1/2 cups water (105°-115°F)  
4 cups flour  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/4 cup shortening  
Meat or fruit filling  
Shortening  
1 tablespoon powdered sugar (optional)

### Steps

1. Dissolve yeast in water in a small mixing bowl.

2. Combine flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and cut in shortening.

3. Make a well in center of dry ingredients. Add liquid to dry ingredients and work into a dough.

4. Knead dough until it is smooth and satiny.

5. Roll dough to a 1/4 inch thickness on a lightly floured board. Cut pastry into circles 3 inches in diameter.[^2]

8. Fry empanaditas until golden on both sides, turning once. Drain on absorbent towels.

9. Sprinkle empanaditas with powdered sugar, if desired.
