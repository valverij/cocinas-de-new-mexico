## Jalea de Cacto (Cactus Jelly)

**Yield:** 6 half-pints  
**Temperature:** High, Medium-High  
**Processing Time:** 5 minutes

### Ingredients

Prickly pears[^1]  
Boiling water  
Cheesecloth  
3 cups sugar  
1/2 cup lemon juice  
6 ounces liquid fruit pectin

### Steps

1. Place prickly pears in a large saucepan or kettle. Cover prickly pears with boiling water, allow to stand for 2-3 minutes, and pour off water. (This aids in softening stickers of prickly pears.)

2. Peel prickly pears, cut into pieces, and place in a medium-sized saucepan. Cover prickly pears with water and boil at high heat for 5 minutes.

3. Pour boiled mixture through cheesecloth. Drain as much juice as possible. Discard seeds.

4. Measure juice. Combine 3 cups of cactus juice, sugar, and lemon juice in a large saucepan or kettle.

5. Bring mixture to a rolling boil. Reduce heat to medium-high, add liquid pectin, and cook mixture for 8-12 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Skim off any foam that may have formed.

6. Pour mixture into hot, sterilized, half-pint canning jars. Seal jars according to manufacturer's directions.

7. Process jars in a Boiling Water Bath for five minutes. Test seal when cooled.

**NOTE:** Cactus jelly may "jell" soon after processing or can take as long as 2 to 3 weeks.

### Boiling Water Bath

A Boiling Water Bath is the cooking of food in jars for a set period of time. The boiling water bath seals the lids of the jars to prevent bacterial entry, and the heating of the jars destroys the bacteria, enzymes, molds, and yeast in the food inside the jars. The jars are immersed in a large container filled with boiling water. The water must cover the tops of the jars by 2 inches throughout the boiling time.

[^1]: Prickly pears are fruit that is left on the prickly pear cactus plant after the cactus has bloomed. The prickly pears may range in color from yellow-green to deep purple-red. The pears may range in size from that of an apricot to 6-inches long. For this reason, there is no accurate way of judging how many pears it may take to obtain a given amount.
