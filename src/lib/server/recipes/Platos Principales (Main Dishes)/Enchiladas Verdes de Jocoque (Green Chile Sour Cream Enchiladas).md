## Enchiladas Verdes de Jocoque (Green Chile, Sour Cream Enchiladas)

**Yield:** 3 servings  
**Temperature:** Medium-High, Medium, 350°F  
**Heating Time:** Approximately 15 minutes

### Ingredients

3 cups chicken broth  
3 tablespoons flour  
1 cup cooked chicken  
1 cup chopped green chile[^1]  
1/2 teaspoon garlic salt  
Shortening  
9 Corn Tortillas[^2]  
2 cups grated sharp cheddar cheese  
1 medium onion, chopped  
2 cups sour cream

### Steps

1. Combine 1 cup of broth with the flour in a medium-sized saucepan. Add the remaining broth and cook on medium heat until thickened.

2. Stir the chicken, chile, and garlic salt into broth and set aside.

3. Heat 1/2 inch of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

4. Quickly dip each tortilla into the shortening to soften. Drain on absorbent towels.

5. Combine 1 cup cheese, onion, and sour cream in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

6. Assemble the enchiladas by placing 1/4 cup of sauce on each dinner plate, followed by a tortilla, 1/4 cup of sauce, and 1/3 cup of sour cream mixture. Top with remaining sauce and cheese.

7. Place in a 350°F oven for 15 minutes, or until cheese melts.

**NOTE:** Traditionally, enchiladas are topped with a fried or poached egg before serving.
