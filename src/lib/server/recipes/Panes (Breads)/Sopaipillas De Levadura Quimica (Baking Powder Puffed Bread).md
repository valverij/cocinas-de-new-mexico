## Sopaipillas de Levadura Quimica (Baking Powder Puffed Bread)

**Yield:** 4 dozen medium sopaipillas  
**Temperature:** Medium-High  
**Total Frying Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Freezes Well**

### Ingredients

4 cups flour  
2 teaspoons baking powder  
1 teaspoon salt  
4 tablespoons shortening  
1 1/2 cups warm water  
Shortening for frying

### Steps

1. Combine dry ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl and cut in shortening.

2. Make a well in center of dry ingredients. Add water to dry ingredients and work into dough.

3. Knead dough until smooth, cover, and set aside for 20 minutes.

4. Heat 2 inches of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

5. Roll dough to a 1/8-inch thickness on a lightly floured board. Cut dough into 4-inch squares and fry until golden on both sides, turning once. (If shortening is sufficiently hot, the sopaipillas will puff and become hollow shortly after being placed in the shortening.)

6. Drain sopaipillas on absorbent towels.

**NOTE:** Sopaipillas may be served as a bread with any New Mexican menu. They may be served with honey, dusted with a sugar-cinnamon mixture and served as a dessert, or may be filled. See Stuffed Sopaipilla recipe.
