## Tortillas de Maiz (Corn Tortillas)

**Yield:** 12-14 tortillas  
**Temperature:** Medium-High  
**Total Cooking Time:** 25-30 minutes  
**Freezes Well**

### Ingredients

2 cups blue or yellow corn Masa Harina[^1]  
1 teaspoon salt  
1 2/3 cups boiling water

### Steps

1. Combine Masa Harina and salt in a medium-sized mixing bowl.

2. Add boiling water and stir until dough resembles thick, cooked cereal.

3. Wet hands and form dough into balls the size of an egg.

4. Place each ball of dough between two lightly moistened pieces of waxed paper and flatten to about 1/8 inch thick, using a tortilla press, rolling pin, or pressure from the hands. Remove tortilla from waxed paper[^2].

5. Heat griddle or skillet on medium-high heat. Place each tortilla on the griddle and cook for approximately 1 minute on each side[^3]. (Tortillas should be lightly speckled.)

[^1]: Masa Harina is available in the cereal section of most grocery stores.
[^2]: **Editor's Note:** If dough sticks to wax paper, use a plastic or compostable grocery or produce bag. Plastic storage bags may also work.
[^3]: **Editor's Note:** Alternatively, flip after 30 seconds, cook on the second side about 1 minute, then flip back to the first for another 30 seconds - 1 minute. Tortilas should puff as they cook. Store stacked in a tortilla warmer or under a clean tea towel until ready to serve.
