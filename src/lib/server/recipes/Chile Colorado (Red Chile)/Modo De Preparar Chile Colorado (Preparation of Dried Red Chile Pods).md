# Chile Colorado (Red Chile)

## Modo De Preparar Chile Colorado (Preparation of Dried Red Chile Pods)

The "ristras" that decorate New Mexico's countryside in the fall are strings of red chiles sundrying for preservation and later use in sauces.

All red chile recipes are prepared from native grown chile. Canned, red chile powder available in the "spice section" of grocery stores should not be substituted.[^1]

**Temperature:** 250°F  
**Roasting Time:** Approximately 10 minutes

### Ingredients

Dried red chile pods, stems removed

### Steps

1. Rinse and dry chile pods. Remove seeds, if desired.

2. Place chile pods on a cookie sheet in a 250°F oven for approximately 10 minutes. Turn chile pods several times to avoid scorching (the chile pods will turn a deeper red).

3. The toasted chile pods may be used for preparing red chile powder, or chile sauce (see below).

[^1]: Editors's note: Usually prepared chili, chili powders, and salsas contain a lot of ingredients that are not chile. Also, different chile peppers have different tastes. Only New Mexico chiles taste like New Mexico chiles.
