## Sopaipillas de Levadura (Yeast Puffed Bread)

**Yield:** 4 dozen medium sopaipillas  
**Temperature:** Medium-High  
**Total Frying Time:** 15-20 minutes  
**Freezes Well**

### Ingredients

1 package active dry yeast  
1/4 cup warm water (105°-115°F)  
1 1/4 cups scalded milk, cooled  
4 cups flour  
1 1/2 teaspoons salt  
1 teaspoon baking powder  
1 tablespoon sugar  
1 tablespoon shortening  
Shortening for frying

### Steps

1. Dissolve yeast in water and add to milk.

2. Combine dry ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl and cut in shortening.

3. Make a well in center of dry ingredients. Add liquid to dry ingredients and work into a dough.

4. Knead dough for 10 minutes, or until smooth; cover, and set aside.

5. Heat 2 inches of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

6. Roll dough to a 1/8 inch thickness on a lightly floured board. Cut dough into 4-inch squares and fry until golden on both sides, turning once. (If the shortening is sufficiently hot, the sopaipillas will puff and become hollow shortly after being placed in the shortening).

7. Drain sopaipillas on absorbent towels.

**NOTE:** Sopaipillas may be served as a bread with any New Mexican menu. They may be served with honey, dusted with a sugar-cinnamon mixture and served as a dessert, or may be filled. See Stuffed Sopaipilla recipe.
