## Azucardo Para Buñuelos (Glaze for Buñuelos)

**Yield:** Approximately 5 cups  
**Temperature:** Medium  
**Heating Time:** Approximately 5 minutes

### Ingredients

1 1/2 cups sugar  
1 1/2 cups brown sugar  
1 1/2 cups water  
3 tablespoons margarine  
1 1/2 teaspoons cinnamon  
3 tablespoons dark corn syrup

### Steps

1. Combine all ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan.

2. Heat at medium heat until sugar dissolves, stirring constantly. Boil mixture rapidly for 1-2 minutes, or until two drops of syrup run together off spoon. (The glaze will be a thin syrup.)

3. Remove glaze from heat and cool for several minutes. Dip each buñuelo into the glaze, one at a time, coating both sides evenly.

4. Drain buñuelos on a rack for 30 minutes (glaze will be slightly sticky) before serving.
