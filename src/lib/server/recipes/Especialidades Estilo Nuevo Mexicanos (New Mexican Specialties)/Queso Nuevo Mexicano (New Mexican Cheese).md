## Queso Nuevo Mexicano (New Mexican Cheese)

**Yield:** Approximately 1 pound  
**Temperature:** Low  
**Heating Time:** 10-15 minutes

### Ingredients

16 cups milk  
2 rennet tablets  
4 tablespoons water  
Cheesecloth  
1-pound can

### Steps

1. Warm the milk to 90°F in a large kettle, using low heat.

2. Dissolve the rennet tablets in water in a small mixing bowl. Add dissolved tablets to warm milk and set mixture aside for 30 minutes. (The mixture will develop into a curd.)

3. Pour curd into a cloth bag or cheesecloth and allow the whey (liquid) to completely drain.

4. Open a 1-pound can at both ends and pierce the can around the sides. Pack cheese into the can and allow it to drain for 3-4 hours before serving.

**NOTE:** Queso Nuevo Mexicano is traditionally served with preserves or syrup.
