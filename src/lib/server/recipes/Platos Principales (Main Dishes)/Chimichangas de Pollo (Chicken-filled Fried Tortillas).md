**Yield:** 8 servings  
**Temperature:** Medium-High, Medium, Low  
**Total Cooking Time:** Approximately 1 hour 45 minutes

### Ingredients

1 3 1/2 pound whole chicken  
6 cups water  
1 medium onion, studded with 2 whole cloves  
2 stalks celery  
2 large whole garlic cloves, peeled  
1 bay leaf  
2 tablespoons shortening  
1 large onion, thinly sliced  
1 garlic clove, minced  
1 large tomato, cored and diced  
1 jalapeño chile[^1]  
1 teaspoon salt  
1/8 teaspoon black pepper  
1/4 teaspoon crushed leaf oregano  
1/4 teaspoon crushed leaf basil  
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon  
8 Flour Tortillas, warmed[^2]  
Shortening  
2 cups sour cream (optional)  
1 cup Guacamole[^3] (optional)  
2 cups grated cheddar cheese (optional)  
Shredded lettuce (optional)  
Tomato wedges (optional)

### Steps

1. Place the chicken, water, onion, celery, 2 garlic cloves, and bay leaf in a medium-sized stewing pot. Cook chicken at medium heat for approximately 1 1/2 hours, or until the chicken is tender. Allow chicken to cool, remove meat from bones, and chop. (Broth from chicken may be reserved for future use).

2. Place shortening, sliced onion, and 1 minced garlic clove in a medium-sized skillet and sauté mixture at medium heat until onion is tender. Add the chopped chicken, tomato, jalapeño chile, and remaining seasonings and simmer at low heat for 10-15 minutes.

3. Place approximately 1/2 cup of chicken mixture horizontally across the bottom half of each tortilla. Do not extend the mixture beyond 1 1/2 inches at the sides and bottom. Fold the sides in over the filling and roll the tortilla jelly-roll style. Secure each roll with a toothpick.

4. Heat 2-inches of shortening in a heavy pan at medium-high heat.

5. Fry each rolled tortilla in hot shortening until crisp and lightly browned. Drain on absorbent towels.

6. Assemble the chimichangas by placing each rolled tortilla on a plate and garnish with 1/4 cup of sour cream, 2 tablespoons of guacamole, 1/3 cup of cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato wedges.
